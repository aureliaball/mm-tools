This website is a customized version of the [MolSSI Molecular Mechancs Tools workshop](https://education.molssi.org/mm-tools/) created for the [Skidmore Computational Biophysics Lab](https://academics.skidmore.edu/blogs/computationalbiophysicslab/). All others should visit the original MolSSI site.

## Introduction

In this lesson we will carry out an MD simulation of the protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). This was one of the first proteins to ever be simulated in its entirety, and the results of this simulation – that at its time was a computational tour de force – can be found in a Nature article from 1977 by Andy McCammon, Bruce Gelin, and Martin Karplus (co-recipient of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry).  We will carry out a very similar simulation in just a few minutes!

## Starting structure and simulation preliminaries

Before you start, sign on to the pugetsound cluster.

The X-ray crystal structures (and NMR-derived structures) of many folded proteins can be found at the [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org). Every structure deposited in the PDB has a four character code; for this exercise we will use the structure 4PTI. This structure was deposited in 1982 (!), but has excellent resolution (1.5 Å) and provides a good starting point for our simulation.

Taking a structure from the PDB and getting it ready for simulation is not a trivial task. For us to carry out a gas phase simulation of this protein, crystallographic waters must be removed and disulfide bonds between various cysteine residues must be specified. Then, to run a simulation of this protein in water, we must add in water molecules. Thankfully there are applications that help to automate this task. In this particular case, the application pdb4amber (part of the [AmberTools distribution](http://www.ambermd.org) was used to generate an appropriate [pdb file](../data/bpti_gas.pdb). Then another AmberTools application, tleap, was used to create parameter/topology files and starting coordinate files that can be understood by Amber or OpenMM.  If you want to learn more about how to use these tools, see the yellow box below, but you can also just copy all five of these files from the chem_shared directory. 

`cp /data/chem_shared/tutorial_files/bpti_* ./`

For this exercise, we will be using the Amber ff14SB protein force field.

> ## Getting the PDB file ready for the simulation
> To prepare the initial parameter/topology file and the input coordinate file, you will need AmberTools18.  
> - Download the file 4PTI.pdb from the PDB website into the directory of your choice.
> - In a terminal window, change to that directory and type the following commands:
>
> ~~~
> module load amber18/18
> pdb4amber -i 4PTI.pdb -o 4PTI_withCYX.pdb --dry --nohyd
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> - Create a text file `setup_BPTI.leap` with the following content:
>
> ~~~
> source leaprc.protein.ff14SB
> ffmodw = loadamberparams frcmod.ff99SB_w_dih
> source leaprc.water.tip3p
> loadamberparams frcmod.tip3pfb
> bpti = loadpdb 4PTI_withCYX.pdb
> bond bpti.5.SG bpti.55.SG
> bond bpti.14.SG bpti.38.SG
> bond bpti.30.SG bpti.51.SG
> saveamberparm bpti bpti_gas.prmtop bpti_gas.inpcrd
> savepdb bpti bpti_gas.pdb
> solvateoct bpti TIP3PBOX 10.0
> addionsrand bpti Cl- 0
> addionsrand bpti Na+ 0
> saveamberparm bpti bpti_wat.prmtop bpti_wat.inpcrd
> quit
> ~~~
>
> - Back in the Terminal Window, copy the force field modification file to your current directory:
> 
> ~~~
> cp /data/chem_shared/tutorial_files/frcmod.ff99SB_w_dih ./
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
> 
> Enter the following command.
>
> ~~~
> tleap -f setup_BPTI.leap
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> This will create the Amber-format prmtop and inpcrd files for BPTI in the gas phase, as well as an Amber-friendly pdb file.
{: .callout}

## MD simulation protocol
Before you begin, make sure the pdb file, parameter/topology file, and the starting coordinate file are in the same directory as your jupyter notebook where you plan to run the simulation.

Sign on to a compute node by typing `srun --partition=Legacy_Nodes --pty --nodes=1 --tasks-per-node=1 --gres=gpu:1 --time=24:00:00 --share --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash`. Note the node you are signed on to by looking at the prompt (it should be a number from 1 to 8).

Load the latest version of python by typing `module load anaconda3/python-3.7`.
Open a jupyter notebook by typing `jupyter notebook --no-browser`. Note the local host number. In a separate terminal window on your local computer, log in to that jupyter notebook on the compute node by typing `ssh -L 8157:127.0.0.1:#### username@cnode00#.skidmore.edu` where '####' is the local host number of your jupyter notebook and where 'cnode00#' is whichever node you are running the jupyter notebook on.
Open a browser window and navigate to `http://localhost:8157/`.
Open a new jupyter notebook and name it `BPTI_gas_OpenMM`.

We will carry out a simulation protocol very similar to that of McCammon et al. (as well as our earlier exercises), with ​some​ modernized aspects to it:
1. Up to 100 steps of energy minimization using the L-BFGS algorithm. [In the original study the authors performed 100 steps of MD with initial velocities set to zero/a starting temperature of 0 K.]
2. A 1.0 ps MD simulation to bring the BPTI protein to an equilibrium temperature of 298 K (25 °C). [Original study: velocities from previous phase are multiplied by 1.5 and then 0.25 ps of equilibration in the NVE ensemble are performed, after which the system is at 285 K. This means the simulation was carried out without thermostatting and instead the total energy of the system – kinetic + potential – was conserved.]
3. A 9.0 ps MD simulation at 298 K in which structures are saved ​every step​ (1 fs) into a file called ​BPTI_gas_sim_1.dcd.​ [This is basically identical to the original study except that the original was again performed without thermostatting. Additional note: These days we usually do not save protein coordinates more frequently than once every 1 ps, but our simulations are typically 5-6 orders of magnitude longer than 40 years ago!]

### Importing required python libraries
First, import the required python as you did in the previous lesson.

~~~
from simtk.openmm import app
import simtk.openmm as mm
from simtk import unit
from sys import stdout
import time as time
~~~
{: .language-python}

### Simulation setup up
Specify the parameter/topology file and the initial coordinate file.  Again, make sure the files you downloaded are in the same directory as the jupyter notebook where you are running the simulation.  

~~~
prmtop = app.AmberPrmtopFile('bpti_gas.prmtop')
inpcrd = app.AmberInpcrdFile('bpti_gas.inpcrd')

system = prmtop.createSystem(constraints=app.HBonds)
integrator = mm.LangevinIntegrator(298.15*unit.kelvin, 1.0/unit.picoseconds,
    1.0*unit.femtoseconds)

platform = mm.Platform.getPlatformByName('CUDA')
simulation = app.Simulation(prmtop.topology, system, integrator, platform)
simulation.context.setPositions(inpcrd.positions)
if inpcrd.boxVectors is not None:
    simulation.context.setPeriodicBoxVectors(*inpcrd.boxVectors)
~~~
{: .language-python}

### Energy minimization
Minimize the energy of the initial structure.  You should see that the energy decreases from the minimization procedure.

~~~
st = simulation.context.getState(getPositions=True,getEnergy=True)
print("Potential energy before minimization is %s" % st.getPotentialEnergy())

print('Minimizing...')
simulation.minimizeEnergy(maxIterations=100)

st = simulation.context.getState(getPositions=True,getEnergy=True)
print("Potential energy after minimization is %s" % st.getPotentialEnergy())
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Potential energy before minimization is -2108.982628950387 kJ/mol
Minimizing...
Potential energy after minimization is -5073.176745362812 kJ/mol
~~~
{: .output}

### Equilibration simulation
As in our previous activity, we will first perform a short equilibration simulation.  

~~~
simulation.context.setVelocitiesToTemperature(298.15*unit.kelvin)
print('Equilibrating...')
simulation.step(1000)
print('Done!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Equilibrating...
Done!
~~~
{: .output}

### Production simluation

For our production simulation, while we will save the coordinates to the trajectory file every 1 fs, we will print the energy in our jupyter notebook much mess frequently, so that we don't have 9000 lines printing!  Once the simulation is finished, the total time for the simulation will be printed.  Note that your computer may be faster or slower, so your total time will probably be different than the example given here.

~~~
simulation.reporters.append(app.DCDReporter('bpti_gas_sim_1.dcd', 1))
simulation.reporters.append(app.StateDataReporter(stdout, 250, step=True, time=True,
    potentialEnergy=True, temperature=True, speed=True, separator='\t'))

tinit=time.time()
print('Running Production...')
simulation.step(9000)
tfinal=time.time()
simulation.saveState('bpti_gas_sim_1.xml')
print('Done!')
print('Time required for simulation:', tfinal-tinit, 'seconds')
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Trajectory analysis

Your overall goal in the exercise below is to reproduce – in a rough way – Figure 3a from McCammon et al. paper.  (Remember this figure was made in 1977!)

[Just by eyeballing the range of N-H bond lengths in this plot, the distribution of the N-H bond length should look ​very​ different from the C-H bond lengths in the butane simulation. What’s different about this simulation?]

> 3. Convert the φ, ψ, and ω torsions from radians to degrees and then plot > them vs. time for 2.0 ps, also beginning with step 5000. You might notice that the ω torsion plot looks suboptimal because this torsion angle oscillates around ±180°. How might we fix it to look more human-readable?
> 4. IN CLASS EXERCISE: Copy your BPTI_gas_OpenMM notebook and call the new notebook BPTI_wat_OpenMM. Modify this notebook to run the same simulation, but this time on the BPTI protein in water. You will need to add an additional minimization and equilibration of just the water with restraints on the protein (see the [OpenMM documentation](http://docs.openmm.org/7.0.0/userguide/application.html#force-fields)). Compare the speed of this simulation to the BPTI in gas. What explains this difference? Complete the same analysis of the BPTI simulation in water. Do you notice any differences?
